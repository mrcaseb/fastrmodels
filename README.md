The R package fastrmodels is a lower level data-only package that
includes all models required by the nflfastR package. Since the models
take up significant file size, they have been swapped out of the
nflfastR package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of fastrmodels from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fastrmodels")
```
